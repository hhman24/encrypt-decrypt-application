# 🔐 Encrypt-Decrypt-application

Write an application that uses C# to encrypt and decrypt a file.
- Use `AES` to encrypt file p into file C and generate private key Ks
- Use `RSA` to generate Kprivate and Kpublic and encrypt Ks by Kpublic.
- Hash Kprivate into Ks and store hash value 
- Output Kprivate and user can use it to decrypt file.
